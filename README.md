# Welcome

This is a recruitment project for front end developer applying to Buypass.

## Prerequisites
* Node
* Yarn or npm
* git
* Github account

## Getting started
Get up and running by cloning the project and run `yarn install` to install all dependencies. To start the development server run `yarn start`. This will launch your default web browser at localhost:3000 with HMR enabled.

## The task at hand
We'd like you to create a small React Redux application displaying pot information from a fictive lottery. You are free to solve the task as you want, any third party library, project architecture or component structure is up to you. We've used create-react-app to bootstrap the project, and created the redux store and actions for you, use that as you please. Launch the application to see a bit more description.

## Share your solution
Clone the project and share your solution with us on your personal GitHub repository.
